<p>
I would describe myself as a generalizing specialist; I enjoy the process of learning new skills and have a tendency to dig deep into areas I find particulaily interesting. Among these are medical technology, cybersecurity, server environments and the inner workings of consumer electronics.
<br><br>
Every now and then I write a piece about one my areas of interest. You can find all of my authored posts in the <a href="{% link navigation/blog.html %}">Blog</a> section. If you have questions or wish to get in touch, see the <a href="{% link navigation/contact.md %}">Contact</a> section.
