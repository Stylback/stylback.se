# Privacy Statement
This page outlines what kind of data I (Jonas Stylb√§ck) collect, store and process during your visit to this website (www.stylback.se). If you have any question with regards to the contents of this page, do not hesitate to contact me through any of the means outlined in the [Contact]({% link navigation/contact.md %}) section.

## Data Collection
HTTP metadata (from now on referred to as "data") is automatically sent to my web server during your visit. Among this data is:

- Your public IP-address.
- Your [User-Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-Agent_header).
- What page was requested.
- Timestamp of request.

For more information on what kind of data is sent during a typical web interaction, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP).

I do not collect any other form of data.

## Data Storage
Data is stored in plain-text log files after collection. This process is automatically conducted by the web server. The web server is located in Sweden and subject to Swedish law and regulations.

## Data Retention
Log files containing the data are neither automatically nor regularly pruned / deleted. Copies of the data are regularily backed up to external storage devices. As such, data and data copies are retained indefinetly unless manually deleted.

## Data Usage
I analyse collected data to gain general information on the behavior of visitors. For example:

- To gauge the number of unique visitors over time.
- To understand what pages, if any, are popular among visitors.
- To understand whether page contents are more popular in certain countries or not.
- To understand whether desktop or mobile devices are more popular among visitors.

In addition, I integrate data with other local systems to identify malicious behavior. If IP-addresses are found to regularily conduct malicious actions towards my web server, they are blocked.

## Cookies
No [Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) are used on this website.

## Third party access
I do not allow third parties to access data that I have collected.

## External resources and assets
Resources and assets needed to render any given page on this website, such as fonts and images, are directly provided by the web server. As such, your browser does not need to fetch resources or assets from a third-party, such as a [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), to render page content.
