            I'm Jonas and this is my website, it's a space of my own to highlight my projects and share some of the things I've learned.
            <br /><br />
            I have a generally broad interest in the field of technology and have a tendency to dabble in this and that.
            Particularly I've found an interest in the areas of self-hosting, cybersecurity and OSINT.
            I also have a secondary interest in medical technology and giving new life to old hardware.
            <br /><br />
            Once a month I write a piece about one my areas of interest. You can find all of my authored posts in the <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> section.
            If you have questions or wish to get in touch, see the <a href="/contact/">Contact</a> section.
