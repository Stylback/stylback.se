<h1>Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</h1>

<div class="content-box">
    
    <h3>I believe I've found a vulnerability</h3>
    <p>
        First; thank you for taking the time to look up this policy page.
        <br>
        Second; <b>please contact me with details on the vulnerability and what you believe could be done to mitigate it.</b>
        <br /><br />
        Once I've recieved your message, I will take a few days to verify and understand the vulnerability.
        During this time I might also have to conduct triage or implement temporary safeguards, depending on how serious the vulnerability is.
        I will then write back to you to acknowledge I've recieved the message and what I plan to do next.
        <br /><br />
        Once I've resolved the vulnerability I will contact you again to confirm the vulnerability is no longer present.
        Once the vulnerability has been confirmed to no longer be present, I will offer you my thanks and a spot on my <a href="/thanks/">acknowledgement</a> page.
        <br /><br />
        I make every effort to resolve vulnerabilities, assuming they are within my power to resolve.
        If I believe the vulnerability is outside my area of control, I will thank you for the disclosure and try my best to point you to others that are in a position to resolve it.
        <br /><br />
        If you need to contact me with especially sensitive information, please encrypt your message with PGP.
        Here is a command to import my public PGP key (remember to verify!):

    <h3>I would like to poke around for vulnerabilities, is that OK?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, I do however ask three things of you:
        <ol>
            <li>That you act in good faith.</li>
            <li>That you do not use methods that harm, damage, or disrupts my services nor use methods that are illegal.
                These methods include DoS/DDoS:ing my server, trying to phis me or physically breaking into my home.</li>
            <li>That if you do find a vulnerability, you contact me so that I get an opportunity to try and fix it.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>I might've broken something, am I in trouble?</h3>
    <p>
        If you've acted in good faith, I assure you that I will not be making any complaints to law enforcement or otherwise.
        <br /><br />
        Accidents happens and are a part of the learning process.
        I would rather that you accidentally break things in good faith today than someone else intentionally breaking them in bad faith tomorrow.
        <br /><br />
        If something were to happen, I urge you to contact me with an honest description of the event and we will take it from there.
    </p>

    <h3>I have concerns or questions with regards to this policy</h3>
    <p>
        I would love to hear it, please send me an email and we can take it from there.
